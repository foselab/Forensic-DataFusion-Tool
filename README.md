Forensic-DataFusion-Tool enables users to preprocess and merge raw and preprocessed data from multiple sensors, speeding up data fusion and enabling future machine learning updates, including classification algorithms. The current version 1.0 of the application allows one to explore the fused data through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

This project is compatible with Python 3.8 or higher. Compatibility with earlier versions has not been verified. Install the required packages using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To start the application, move to ``code`` and execute:
```
python home.py
```
